    <h2></h2>

    <p>I am a small-town girl living in Orangeville, Utah. It’s one of those places that no one has ever heard of - that
        suits me just fine. I am married to a self-proclaimed “computer geek” who works as the Technology Director of
        our local school district. I have two children. My son served in the England London South Mission and has just
        completed his Master's degree in Information Systems. He was recently married and is working as an IT manager
        for an engineering firm. My daughter is working as a Registered Nurse and is studying to be a Nurse
        Practitioner. (I have really smart kids, if I do say so myself.) I also have the most beautiful granddaughter -
        the best thing ever! My family is my pride and joy!
